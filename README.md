In this GitHub repository, you can find all the necessary code of our implementation of a Business Classification problem, where given an image, our model is able to classify it to one of the different propsed classes.

In the dataset we can find 28 different business categories, which can be for instance: Bakery, Book Store, Motel and many others. As well as 24,255 images in total. In order to be able to obtain the images used for this task, you can click http://isis-data.science.uva.nl/jvgemert/images.tar.gz to directly downlead them.


Con-Text dataset is built from sub-categories of the ImageNet "building" and "place of business" sets to evaluate fi¬Åne-grained classification. The dataset consists of 28 categories with 24,255 images in total. Note that this dataset is not specifically build for text recognition and thus not all the images have text in them. Moreover, high variability of text size, location, resolution and style and, uncontrolled environmental settings ( illumination ) make text recognition from this dataset harder.
